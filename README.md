# Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

### Description

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate an ability to clean a data set and prepare 
tidy data that is suitable for later analyis. The dataset used is from a UCI experiment concerning human activity recognition using smartphones. The UCI project is described here:

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The dataset contains observations of a number of features for 30 subjects engaging in 6 different activities. The data is split into a 'test' set and a 'train' set. In this project, I combine the test and train data into one dataset, provide descriptive labels for the activities, select a subset of features, and create a tidy data frame containing the average value for each of these features for each subject during each activity.

The code to download, read, and manipulate the data is found in run_analysis.R.

The final tidy data is in averages.txt.

### Data

The data for this project were obtained from:
